# C-Sharp-SmallProjects
I'm Re-learning C#

So long story short, i had C# classes in my school course, but when i started my professional career i decided to go with React (in which i also had some classes), but recently i decided to Re-learn C#, by Re-Creating some of the projects i did in school, projects which i lost, they were in a pendrive that i have no idea where it is.

Throughout the projects i will write a little text, explaining what each script does, and my experience coding when i have a schooler, and now, mainly to show how i evolved, even in a language that i don't remember that well
