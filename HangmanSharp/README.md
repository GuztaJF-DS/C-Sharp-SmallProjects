# Hangman
This one i did in the second year of school when i was a decent developer, i didn't struggle with this one, neither when i was young nor i did now, it is just Hangman after all, i just needed to think a bit on how to do the winning check part, and to remember how to use matrix, not gonna lie, after using Javascript's matrix for a while, going back to C#'s is a nice change.
