Another relatively simple project, so i can't remember if young me thought this was that hard, but i sure remember that it took a while to make, mainly because there was a lot of details to put, and yeah i was correct, this one took me two day to make (but to be fair i didn't dedicated that much hours, like i'd say it took about two hours of constant work to get this done), i also used phind to help me make the ValidateInput function, because i had no idea of how to send a function as a param, and it helped me a lot, i will keep using it until it inevitabily becomes paid, because we can't have cool stuff under captalism, anyway, great tool, i will now make an windows forms calculator, which i remebered beign harder that it should be, let's see if my entire class was just dumb, or if this is harder than it should be.
